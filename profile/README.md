# Cratis

Cratis is synonymous with **developer friendly**, aimed at putting developers in the pit of success.
This is done through different libraries supporting you as a developer. These libraries also feed
the main product of Cratis; [***Chronicle***](https://github.com/cratis/chronicle) - the easy to use and flexible event sourcing database.

All documentation can be found at [https://cratis.io](https://cratis.io).
